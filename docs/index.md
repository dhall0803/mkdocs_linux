# About

Hello and welcome! 

This is a collection of notes on linux which I am writing to help me prepare for the CompTIA Linux+ exam, and keep track of the concepts and commands I am learning.

The notes are organised into categories, a list of which you can find below:

## Categories:

### [Networking](./networking)

### [User Management](./usermanagement)
