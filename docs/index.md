Hello and welcome! 

This is a collection of notes on linux which I am writing to help me prepare for the CompTIA Linux+ exam, and keep track of the concepts and commands I am learning.

The notes are organised into topics with examples give for the distributions used in the exam (CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 20.04) as well the latest LTS release of Ubuntu (as of now 20.04) and the latest release of CentOS (Stream 8). 

Here are the categories covered:
